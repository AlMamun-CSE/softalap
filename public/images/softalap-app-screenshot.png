Design a modern, professional landing page inspired by getbubble.com, but with a unique and differentiated visual identity.

Core requirements:

Clean, minimal layout with plenty of white space.

Hero section with bold headline, subtext, and a clear call-to-action button.

Use a color palette that feels innovative and tech-forward (for example, deep blue + neon accents, or pastel gradients with contrast highlights).

Replace the bubble-style illustrations with sleek vector graphics or abstract 3D shapes.

Typography should be bold, modern, and highly legible (e.g., sans-serif fonts with character).

Sections:

Hero banner (headline, tagline, CTA button).

Features grid (3â€“4 features with icons/graphics).

Customer testimonials or success highlights.

Pricing or product showcase.

Footer with navigation + social links.

Ensure mobile responsiveness with smooth transitions.

Add subtle micro-animations (hover effects, fade-ins, button interactions) to make the site feel alive.

Differentiation from getbubble.com:

Instead of circles/bubbles, use geometric elements (hexagons, flowing lines, glassmorphism panels, or futuristic gradients).

More dynamic section separation (angled dividers, layered backgrounds, overlapping cards).

Unique call-to-action buttons with gradient or neon glow styles.

Mood/Style references: Modern SaaS, futuristic, tech-savvy, startup-friendly. Think of a site that feels like a next-gen platform for builders and creators.
